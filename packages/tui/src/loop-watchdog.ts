/**
 * Always-on event-loop lag probe. Each tick is scheduled `intervalMs` ahead of
 * a recorded deadline; a tick that fires `thresholdMs` past its deadline means
 * the loop was blocked that long. The overshoot is logged once on the rising
 * edge (one block ⇒ one line, deduped via `#wasBlocked`), tagged with the phase
 * active during the elapsed interval via {@link takeRecentLoopPhase} — which
 * survives the synchronous push/pop the instrumented hot paths do before this
 * delayed tick can run — so the stall names its cause instead of "unknown".
 *
 * The handle is `unref`'d so the probe never keeps the process alive, and stop()
 * cancels the armed timer when the handle exposes `cancel` (the default
 * `setTimeout` handle does, via `clearTimeout`). The `#generation` guard remains
 * as a fallback for injected handles that cannot cancel. An overshoot beyond
 * `sleepMs` is treated as system sleep rather than a synchronous stall: the
 * process could not have run JS during the missed interval, and one resume
 * should not produce a multi-minute `ui.loop-blocked` record.
