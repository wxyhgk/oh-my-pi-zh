/**
 * Translate a Pi frame's args into the local tool kwargs that run it.
 *
 * Shared deliberately by three consumers: the provider synthesizes a display
 * block from these, the coding-agent bridge executes with them, and the legacy
 * pi shim performs the identical translation for the old wire. Separate
 * hand-rolled copies drift, and the drift is invisible — the transcript shows
 * one operation while a different one runs.
 *
 * Kept apart from `cursor/exec-modern.ts` on purpose: these are pure
 * string/path functions with no protobuf coupling, while that module pulls in
 * `@bufbuild/protobuf` and the generated `agent_pb` graph. The legacy shim is
 * compiled into the bundled virtual module registry, so importing it from a
 * nested path would drag the whole exec implementation in with it — and
 * `./providers/*` is a single-segment wildcard export that cannot serve a
 * nested specifier under bunfs (issue #3442).
 *
 * Every `optional int32` here is presence-sensitive: `0` is a supplied value,
 * not "unset", so it must never be folded into a default.

 * `offset` is a 1-indexed start clamped like the reference's
 * `Math.max(0, offset - 1)` over 0-indexed lines; `limit` is a line count.
 * `null` marks a present `limit: 0` — zero lines, which no selector expresses
 * and which must not degrade into a whole-file read.
 *
 * The range is `raw` because a plain `:N+K` deliberately pads with one leading
 * and three trailing context lines: helpful for a human reading a snippet,
 * wrong for a caller that asked for exactly `limit` lines from `offset`. The
 * wire result is an opaque `output` string, so the hashline and line-number
 * gutter that `raw` also drops carry nothing the frame's contract needs.
 * A range-free read keeps the ordinary form — whole-file reads want them.
